Why Cybersecurity is important in Ondato:
https://ondato.com/identity-verification/
https://ondato.com/security/

- Startup mentality
- Limited specialist pool
- Security responsibility
- Confidentiality

## Cyber-security user-cases

The experiences of cyber-security practices/uses/flaws/lessons in my career (use cases):
- mostly connected but not limited to .NET programming
- Security is much more than authentication/authorization
- Security is Hard

## Programming and open access API

Twillio Sms Use case:
https://www.twilio.com/

What is an API:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
https://api.twilio.com

Authentication:
https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/csharp-dotnet-core

Issues:
- Where to store a secret so it is not visible in Github.
- How to ensure Sms are sent by authorized people  
- How not to display the secret to the watching people.
- How to know if the secret was stolen
- How to track what has been sent
- How to ensure that a single phone number is not spammed.
- DDos attacks?

## System integration (Smart-id/Mobile-id)

What is Smart-Id?

Understanding external system security:

Analysing the example: learning about SSL, certificates, chaining, signature, etc.

### Features vs Security

- Encrypt data?
- Store data locally?
- How to store passwords?
- Where to store documents?
- Sensible data in code?
- What about DDos?
- Are inputs safe?
- Check uploded files?
- Email/cryptoware
- Social engineering
- Ethical hacking
